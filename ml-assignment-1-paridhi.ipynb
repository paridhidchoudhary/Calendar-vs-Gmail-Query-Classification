Dataset creation (nearly 120 queries, along with the ground truth labels: 0 = gmail , 1 = calendar)\n2. Model selection and training: DistilBERT is selected\n3. Trained model is saved into current working directory and also uploaded as input in order to avoid rerunning of the training loops again, (final trained model is also added as input in the final submission notebook under the name \"calendar_gmail_classifier\")\n4. function predict_class is defined to check the predicted class of individual queries\n5. Additional tasks (Brownie tasks) are done post this: (a). extract_time_range: provides the time if mentioned in calendar related queries\n   (b). extract_people : used to do NER to identify names of people if mentioned in queries\n   (c). analyze_query: overall function to predict class of a particular query, extract date if the predicted class is 1 (calendar realted query) and extract people name if present.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Installations","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install transformers torch\n!pip install dateparser\n!pip install spacy\n!python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm\n\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-12-18T14:25:57.493974Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-12-18T14:25:57.494589Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-12-18T14:26:16.535347Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-12-18T14:25:57.494552Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-12-18T14:26:16.534571Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"huggingface/tokenizers: The current process just got forked, after parallelism has already been used.
